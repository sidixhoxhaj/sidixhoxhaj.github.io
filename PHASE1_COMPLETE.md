## What's Next

**Phase 2: Design System & Dark Mode Foundation**

Build the complete design token system with:
- Black/white aesthetic with shades of grey
- Dark mode support from day one
- CSS custom properties for all design tokens
- Mobile-first, grid-based layouts
- Inter font family integration

## Notes

- CMS integration removed for now - will be added when needed in later phases
- Focus on building the UI first with static/mock data
- Cleaner, simpler foundation to build upon
